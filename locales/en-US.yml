  title: "How to use Misskey"
  step1_1: "Welcome!"
  step1_2: "This page is called \"timeline\". It shows chronologically ordered \"notes\" of people who you \"follow\"."
  step1_3: "Your timeline is currently empty, since you have not posted any notes or followed anyone yet."
  step2_1: "Let's finish setting up your profile before writing a note or following anyone."
  step2_2: "Providing some information about who you are will make it easier for others to follow you back."
  step3_1: "Finished setting up your profile?"
  step3_2: "The next step is to post a note. You can do this by pressing the pencil icon on the screen."
  step3_3: "Fill in the modal and press the button on the top right to post."
  step3_4: "Have nothing to say? Try \"just setting up my msky\"!"
  step4_1: "Finished posting your first note?"
  step4_2: "Hurray! Now your first note is displayed on your timeline."
  step5_1: "Now, let's try making your timeline more lively by following other people."
  step5_2: "{featured} will show you trending notes in this instance. {explore} will let you find trending users. Try following people you like!"
  step5_3: "To follow other users, click on their icon and press \"follow\" button on their profile."
  step5_4: "If the other user has a lock icon next to their name, that user will have to manually approve your follow request."
  step6_1: "Now you will be able to see other users' notes on your timeline."
  step6_2: "You can also put \"reactions\" on other people's notes to quickly respond."
  step6_3: "To attach a \"reaction\", press the \"+\" mark on another user's note and choose an emoji you'd like to react with."
  step7_1: "Congratulations! You have now finished Misskey's basic tutorial."
  step7_2: "If you would like to learn more about Misskey, try the {help} section."
