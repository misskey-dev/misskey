  misskey: "A ⭐ of the fediverse"
  about-title: "A ⭐ of the fediverse."
  about: "Thank you for finding Misskey. Misskey is a <b>decentralized microblogging platform</b> born on Earth. Since it exists within the Fediverse (a universe where various social media platforms are organized), it is mutually linked with other social media platforms. Why don't you take a short break from the hustle and bustle of the city, and dive into a new Internet?"
  intro:
    title: "What is Misskey?"
    about: "Misskey is an open-source, <b>decentralized microblogging software</b>. It has a sophisticated, fully customizable user interface, a variety of ways for expressing a reaction to posts, free file storage providing an integrated management system, and other advanced features are available. In addition, Misskey connects to a network system called the “Fediverse”, which enables us to communicate with users on other SNSs. For example, when you post something, it will be sent not only to Misskey users, but also those on Mastodon and Pleroma. Just imagine that the planet is sending a radio transmission to another planet, in order to communicate."

Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled."

  variables-info: "You can make your page more dynamic by using variables. If you write down <b>{ variable name }</b> in the text, you can embed the value of the variable there. For example, if the source text is <b>Hello { thing } world!</b> and the value of variable 'thing' is <b> ai </b>, that text becomes to <b>Hello ai world!</b>."
  variables-info2: "Because the evaluation(=calculating) of variables are performed from top to bottom, the variable cannot refer another variable which exists on later line. For example, when defining three variables <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>, variable <b>C</b> <i>can</i> refer the variable <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in its expression, but variable <b>A</b> <i>cannot</i> refer the variable <b>B</b> or <b>C</b> in its expression."
  variables-info3: "If you want to get some input from the user, place a 'User Input' block on the page and set the variable name as which you want to store that input in 'variable name' (variables are created automatically). You can use that variable to perform actions in response to user's input."
  variables-info4: "Function allows make your processing logic as group in a reusable way. To create a function, create a variable of type 'Function'. A function can have a slot (Argument) whose value is available as a variable in the function. There are also functions that take functions as arguments in the AiScript standard (called the higher-order function.). In addition to the predefined functions, you can also set them in the slots of such higher-order functions on the fly."
