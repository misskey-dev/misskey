# Word mute
Through setting up word mutes, you can make notes satisfying set conditions not appear on your timeline anymore.

There are two types of word mutes: soft and hard.Below is an explanation of the setup process and effect of both.

## Soft word mute
With soft mutes, the word mute is processed within the client (app) you are using.

When a note meets the set conditions, it will be hidden behind text stating "(username) said something".  
You can display the note as it was by clicking on this text.

## Hard word mute
With hard mutes, the server judges whether the content of a new incoming note meets the set conditions similar to antennas, and will completely exclude it from your timeline if so.

To summarize, a hard word mute has the following features:

* Only new notes created after configuration will be affected by the mute.
* If the conditions are changed, previously hard muted notes will still remain muted.
* Timelines will not be filled with "(...) said something".
* Hard mutes will function even for apps without functionality for soft mutes.
